# Genetic Algorithm Workshop

## Description
you will be implementing a GA that can match a given string 
it is your job to put together a Genetic Algorithm that can do this.
fortunately for you, most of the work has been done, all you have to do is fill out functions for fitness, selectParent, crossover, and mutation.


## Requirements
1. define the fitness function
2. define the selectParent function
3. define the crossover function
4. define the mutate function
